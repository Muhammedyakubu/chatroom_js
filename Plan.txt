Plan for chat app

- make SPA minimalist front end with vanilla js and html/css
    - that means first course of action would be to create a function to display the page into "content" as well as a pages object/dictionary
    - on window load, query an api endpoint to see if the user is logged in using localStorage (maybe using sessions in express?)
        - use localStorage to store username
        - if there is a username, check if the username exists on the server (to prevent injection)
        - if it does, then we can flash a green bar that says "Logged in as ${username}"
        - Otherwise we redirect to the login page and ask them to select a username
    - alternatively, have socket connect and use that to check if user is logged in (by sending an "authenticated" event once user is logged in for "user joined" notifications).
    - if user logged in the display chat page. Otherwise diplay the login page.
    - play sounds on user connect and message send/receive
- make express api with mongoose database
    - To query for users: "GET myserver/users/:username" should return the user object (or username for the MVP) if it exists, or a null if it doesn't
        - maybe for my users use the schema:
         user = {
            id = Date.now().toString(),
            username
        }
    - To create a new user: "POST myserver/users/:username" should add the username to the database of users
    - To query for chats: myserver/chats should return an array containing a list of chat objects
- make a global chat first, push to internet and then work on more features like different rooms and private messaging
