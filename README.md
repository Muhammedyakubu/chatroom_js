A simple Jamstack chat application implemented as a full-stack web-app using websockets. I used [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to handle websocket interactions. 
On the back-end I used the Mongoose ODM, Express.js and Node.js to build a REST API which is hosted on heroku.
On the front-end I utilized vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a Single Page Application (SPA) which is hosted on github pages. I decided to use a SPA and split up the application this way to improve its responsiveness and gain more experience with APIs.

The Front-end is live at üëâüèΩ:https://muhammedyakubu.github.io/chatroom_js/ 

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository locally using __git clone__
2. Navigate to the parent directory (__"chatroom_js"__) in a terminal and type __"npm install"__
3. Wait for the dependencies to install, then run the back-end by typing __"node ."__ in the same directory 
4. To run the front-end, open __"client/index.html"__ in a browser
